        <h2>Welcome Words</h2>
        <p>We, the members of the Junior Council of the KFO5001 Resolve Pain, are pleased to invite you to our Summer School 2024: </p>
            <img src="https://github.com/AmSchulte/resolvepain-summerschool2024/blob/main/Logo%20Summer%20School%20KFO.png?raw=true" alt="Logo" width="300" >  <br><br>
            <p><b>Mark the date! 04th-06th of July 2024. </b> </p>
            <p>The KFO5001 is dedicated to investigating molecular mechanisms of pain resolution and why pain chronifies in some patients while it resolves in others. Our projects range from longitudinal clinical studies, 
            characterizing patients suffering from neuropathic pain to animal and cellular models delving into molecular mechanisms behind pain and its resolution.
            We are happy to look into those subjects as well as life as a scientist with you!</p>
            <p>If you are interested, find more information on our program below.

        <h2>Program Highlights</h2>
        <p>In this Summer School we want to explore mechanisms of pain and therapy as well as methods and models used in (pain) research with local and international speakers.
            We are excited to have visiting scientists <b> Dr. Didier Bouhassira (MD, PhD) and Prof. Dr. Nadine Attal (MD, PhD) </b> as keynote speakers! 
            For further speaker updates, check our Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/ResolvePain">https://twitter.com/ResolvePain</a>. The program will be updated regularly, so stay tuned! </p>

        <p>Beyond the borders of the scientific program, we will look into the subjects of project management, career development, and mental health for young scientists. 
            We are looking forward to fostering an exchange on these topics to help you on your way to navigate science as a career choice.
